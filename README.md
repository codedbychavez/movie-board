## Intro

I made this sample application to get familiar with [Svelte](svelte.dev). I have been using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for some time and wanted to experiment with something new. I made a sample movie board
app that uses the following Svelte features:

### Runes
  - $state
  - $props
  - $bindable

### Template Syntax
  - `{#if ...}`
  - `{#each ...}`
  - bind

### Special Elements
  - `<svelte:head>`

## Build and Run

### Frontend (Svelte + SvelteKit)

1. Clone this repository
2. Using your terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Run `npm run dev` to run and access the app in the browser.

### Backend ([Hono](https://hono.dev/))

1. Using your terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder and run:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Run `npm run dev` to run the backend for the app.
